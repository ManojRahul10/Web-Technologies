Controllers Type
In web frameworks (like MVC - Model View Controller), controllers manage the data flow between the model and the view.
Controller types may refer to:

Front-end Controllers: Handle UI logic (e.g., React components).

Back-end Controllers: Handle requests and return responses (e.g., in Node.js, Laravel, Django).
